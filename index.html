                <p>
                    I have already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. Now, I have to learn RWD using CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS and much more advanced topics. My goal is to build websites with what I have already learned and I shall also continue to learn more advanced topics.

                        I hope that I shall become a professional web developer from the year 2022. So, now it is my goal to finish the Complete Web Development course of Programming-Hero. Because, this course offers Super Charged Interviewee Club (SCIC) for those who will be able to complete the full course within time to ensure more professional training. So, it is my target to get a chance to join the SCIC.
